If you're here, I presume you have already setup `git`, `jekyll`, `ruby`, and the underlying technologies required to get a `jekyll` project up and running.

### 0 Gem or Fork?

There are a couple of ways you can use the `jekyll-wikibonsai` template:

| Way | Why? |
| --- | ---- |
| üíé Import the [[2021-11-18-setup-code#B. Gem|gem]]. | This is ideal if you simply want to play around with [[config]], [[data]], and selectively [override](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults) anything you want to change. If you use the gem, installing and updating `jekyll-wikibonsai` template's new features or bug fixes  is as easy as changing [[gem|one line]] in your project. |
| üç¥ [[2021-11-18-setup-code#A. Fork|Fork]] the template project. | This exposes you directly to the code (namely the styles and layouts), which allows you to tinker with the html, css, javascript, or even [ruby](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/installation/) directly. This is useful if you want to customize the template heavily and don't mind missing out on bug fixes or feature updates. |

### A. Fork

Head to the [`jekyll-wikibonsai`](https://github.com/wikibonsai/jekyll-wikibonsai/) repo and fork the project by clicking the **"Fork"** button in the upper-right.

Then head back to the [[2021-11-18-setup#Clone|clone instructions]]...

### B. Gem

#### B1 Start A New Project

Start a new `jekyll` project:

```
$ jekyll new my-bonsai
```

#### B2 Add Imports

Add [`webrick`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/8523) to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "webrick"
```

Next, add `jekyll-wikibonsai`:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-wikibonsai"
```

Set the theme in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-wikibonsai
```

#### B3 Add Necessary Files

- Add these directories to your project:
  - `_states/`
  - `_entries/`
- Add some markdown documents:
  - Add some states: [[state-type]]
  - Add at least a `root.md` entry: [[entry-type]].
- In `_config.yml`:
  - Add minimum configurations for collections: [[document#config]]
  - Add minimum configurations for frontmatter: [[frontmatter#config]]
- An [[home-page|`index.md`]] is required, but should have been automatically generated by `jekyll new`.

### Back To Setup

And head back to the [[2021-11-18-setup#Run|run instructions]]...
