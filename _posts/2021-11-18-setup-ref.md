If you just want to add some of the features of this template to your pre-existing site and aren't so concerned with specific configurations, you're in the right place. I'm going to assume you don't really need help setting up the underlying technologies to run a `jekyll` project, as you probably have your own already.

If you do need a refresher on the basics, check out the [[2021-11-18-setup-starter|starter setup]]. If you are interested in the configuration specifics, you can check out the [[2021-11-18-setup-code|tinkerer setup]].

## Plugins

If you're starting from your own project or just want to add mechanics similar to `jekyll-garden`'s, the main thing to be aware of is that there are three [[plugin]]s this template relies on heavily besides [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) itself:
- [[jekyll-wikirefs]]
  - Parses \[\[wikilinks]] across the site and renders them in-place as html `a` tags while adding link metadata to the linked documents.
- [[jekyll-semtree]]
  - Processes [[index-type]]s to build the [[semantic-tree]] and [[tree-graph]].
- [[jekyll-graph]]
  - Generates the graph in the sidebar. The [[tree-graph]] graph is generated from [[semantic-tree]] and the [[web-graph]] graph is generated from [[wikirefs]].

## (Jekyll) Document Types

There are several document types in this template, but there are two in particular that do most of the heavy-lifting:

- [[state-type]]: Provides the possible `status` states for all documents.
- [[index-type]]: Markdown files that build the [[semantic-tree]] and [[tree-graph]].
- [[entry-type]]: Wikipedia-style entries that fill out the semantic tree.
- [[book-type]]: Book summaries and outlines.

## Data

- [[theme]]: Multiple theming schemes are possible and are implemented similarly to [this](https://mxb.dev/blog/color-theme-switcher/) color theme switcher.
- [[emojis]]: Customizable emojis not generated from [[state-type]]s.
