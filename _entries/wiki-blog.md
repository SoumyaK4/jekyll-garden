metaphor::[[digital-garden]]


From this gardener's perspective, the new digital gardening phenomenon is the coalescing of wikis and blogs: Instead of a tag cloud, concepts can be viewed and navigated via a semantic [[tree-graph]] or concept [[web-graph|network]]. Single tags also do more than simply listing all posts. Tags map to a wiki-like entry which describes the concept in words and displays complex relationships via [[wikirefs]] and the [[semantic-tree]].

At least, that's this incarnation's guiding philosophy.
