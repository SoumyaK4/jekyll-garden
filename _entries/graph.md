The graph in the sidebar is the main site navigation for this template. You could think of the graph as a [[bonsai]] growing in the sidebar tray.

### Navigate

You can hover over the ðŸ§­ then click the ðŸŒ³ or ðŸ•¸ to toggle the graph's [[graph-type]].

On a node...
- ...click: 
  - You'll be taken to it's corresponding entry page.
- ...hover:
  - Its title will display as a tooltip
  - Net-web `neighbors` or tree `lineage` will highlight.

On a link...
- ...hover: 
  - It will highlight. 
  - Only its neighbor nodes titles will display.

### Config

```yaml
bonsai:
  nav:
    graph:
      type: "tree" # may be 'tree' or 'net-web'
```

`nav.graph.type`: Allows you to set the default [[graph-type]] to be displayed.

For more graph configurations, see [[jekyll-graph]].
