Document types, or 'doctypes', are synonymous with [Jekyll collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/). They are types of markdown documents that are used to render content in specific ways. The following are the doctypes expected to exist in a [[wikibonsai]] [[digital-garden]]:

- [`pages`](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/)
- [`posts`](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)
- [[index-type]]
- [[entry-type]]
