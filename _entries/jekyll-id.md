The `jekyll-id` plugin may be added to ensure [[frontmatter]] IDs exist, generate them for you if necessary, or be added in [`permalink`s](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/). See the [docs](https://github.com/manunamz/jekyll-id) for more details.

⚠️ This plugin should not overwrite pre-existing data, but since this plugin will write directly to markdown files, be sure to backup all data before running this plugin.
