Some documents use a traditional `tags` frontmatter attribute, like [jekyll tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/tags/), with the added bonus that they map to an [[entry-type]] where the filename matches the tag text.

Tags are also supported as [[entry-type#markdown|attributes]] (see [[jekyll-wikirefs]] documentation for more details).
