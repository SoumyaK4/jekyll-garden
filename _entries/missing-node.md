A missing node is when there is wikilinked text with no corresponding [[document]]. The text and wiklinks will print [[like-this]][^eg]. The [[graph]] and [[entry-type|entry-local]] navigation will properly handle missing links and entries.


[^eg]: e.g. There is no entry with the filename `like-this.md`.
