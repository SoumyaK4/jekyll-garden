As [[wikirefs]], networked entry-taking apps, and graphs flower in popularity, a debate has also sparked between networks vs hierarchies.

This template leverages both [[tree-graph]]s (hierarchies) and [[web-graph]]s (networks) so creators and visitors may toggle the perspective and decide for themselves what works well for navigation[^data-structure].


[^data-structure]: Of course, the final experience will depend both on the graphs' inherent natures _and_ how the documents themselves are structured...
